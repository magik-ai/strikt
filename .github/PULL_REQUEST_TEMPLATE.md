<!-- Template: copy to .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md. Keep one template, with
     no variants. The workflow it belongs to is in CLAUDE.md, or in
     .murmur/contract.md if the murmur plugin set up this repository. -->

## Summary
<!-- One or two sentences: what changed and why. This becomes the body of the
     squash-merge commit, so write it for someone reading the history in six
     months. -->

## Parent task
<!-- Link the parent task or issue, and say which part of it this pull request
     delivers. If this pull request is too big to review in one sitting, split
     it in two. -->

## Acceptance guide
<!-- Required when the owner will click through this change. Fill every
     subsection with steps a reader can follow. A docs-only pull request may
     write "N/A: docs only". -->

### What changed
<!-- Describe the change in product terms, so a non-engineer can act on it. -->

### Product features potentially affected
<!-- What else this change can reach, found by tracing the callers and importers
     of the changed code. Say how you found it, not just what you concluded. -->

### How to check
<!-- Concrete click paths and expected results on the preview environment.
     For a CI-only change, name the exact checks and results to look at. -->

### What could have broken
<!-- The real risks, and anything you could not verify. -->

## Checklist
- [ ] Branched from a fresh `main`; this pull request is one coherent batch.
- [ ] The house style rule from CLAUDE.md is followed in the code, the docs and this body.
- [ ] Lint clean and tests green locally; any flaky test that failed before this change is named here.
- [ ] Tests sit at the lowest level that proves the behavior, with stable
      locators, and any gap in coverage is documented.
- [ ] Schema: exactly one new migration, compatible with the deployed code
      (expand now, contract later). _(N/A if the schema is untouched.)_
- [ ] No secrets committed.
- [ ] Adversarial review ran on this head commit; findings fixed or filed.
- [ ] Docs in sync: the law file, the architecture file, the doc index, and the
      matching `docs/knowledge/` domain file, OR none of them applies.
- [ ] A `RELEASE_NOTES.d/<category>-<slug>.md` note is added, OR this body says
      "no user-visible change".

<!-- Add the checklist items that only your repository needs, for example:
- [ ] Layer rules respected: no import goes against the allowed dependency direction.
- [ ] The UI uses registered design-system parts only; the matching story or
      snapshot ships in this pull request.
- [ ] Anything touching prices, keys, enforcement or checkout has the owner's
      explicit approval, and the money checklist was run again.
- [ ] Sensitive user content goes through the encryption wrapper.
- [ ] Language ratchet: every file meaningfully changed here is in the target
      language, with no behavior change in the conversion.
-->

## Notes
<!-- Trade-offs, follow-ups, manual test steps. -->
