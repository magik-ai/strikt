"""Code-rendered strings (card, buttons, errors, /start, /forget_me), one JSON file per language.

The coach's replies are model-written and come out in whatever language the user writes; only what
the *code* renders lives here, in ``telegram/locales/<code>.json``. A locale file carries the
language's native name, the words people use to ask for it, the short weekday and month names, and
the strings themselves. English is the fallback for a key a translation has not caught up with.

Voice (chernyakov.ai ``STYLE.md``): a person talking to a person. Real sentences, never staccato
fragments. A short dash with spaces, never a long one. No emoji, no praise, no marketing words.
Messages stay short: a blank line between blocks reads better in Telegram than one dense block,
and a list is at most four one-line bullets.
